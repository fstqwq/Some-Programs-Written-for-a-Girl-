  I first met her in December and then that whole month changed. During that month, I did a series of crazy things, such as finish that DouDizhu Game Generator in just 5 days(Now I might not be able to get that great job done). I was deeply attracted by her appearance and character, and we also have a lot of things in common. But the harsh reality is that we live in different worlds.
  I wrote two programs for her during that time. In both programs, I used the mathematic algorithm only, whose effect was obviously not as good as using the Windows API. The reason I chose math was because I felt there was a special mathematical beauty in it. But the bad news is that she couldn't understand it.
  Yesterday I got my new computer. When I copied the program I had written, I found that one of the two programs was lost(the "3D Heart").I tried to recreate one yesterday, but failed. It was so hard that I didn't know how I could finish it in two hours one month ago. Today I read some materials about "Finite Difference Algorithm", and finally reproduced it successfully. It looks better than the former one, but I think the former one is much more precious than this one.
  Let it be.
